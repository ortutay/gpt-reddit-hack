People are going to get hurt- it\u2019s called radical political change. The alternative is the fascists are going to win. You should expect that the state will use violence- but we must prepare and organize for and set up roles to help maintain nonviolent discipline in the face of violent repression. \n\nWhen the state uses violence against people who maintain nonviolent discipline while engaged in a just cause, it destroys their moral & political legitimacy and often triggers a backfiring effect where the population responds with a surge of support for the nonviolent movement- often triggering a cascade where more and more people move into nonviolent resistance resulting in the paralyzation of the security forces. This is how you win- when  a critical mass of people decide that they\u2019re going to stand their ground nonviolently no matter what the repurcussions. When they lose their fear of the state- that is when the dynamic turns and power shifts. Every authoritarian ruler depends on the compliance of the population to continue in power. When a critical mass of people withdraw their support and nonviolently oppose the regime, to refuse to obey, they have the power to remove the social pillars of support that the regime depends on to stay in power. \n\n\nCheck out this 11 minute video for an introduction to nonviolent civil resistance to learn more:\n\n[Civil Resistance: a first look ](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=peTbiYrxTxE) (11m54s)", "reply_score": 10, "reply_id": "jcpdtxt"}

At 18 you are a legal adult.\n\n>) Genital and nongenital gender altering surgeries are generally\n3 not recommended for children, although evidence indicates referral for\n4 children to have such surgeries are becoming more frequent; and\n\nSo this bill literally admits this isn't really a thing that happens. \n\n>Biological sex means the biological indication of male and\n11 female in the context of reproductive potential or capacity, such as sex\n12 chromosomes, **naturally occurring sex hormones**\n\nAka the bill is declaring that puberty blockers aren't allowed because they interfere with natural biology as a procedure. The thing trans teens use to hold off puberty long enough for them to become adults and decide if they want to take the next step. So Republicans want to force teens who don't want to go through puberty to go through it because they decided it was bad. Not medical professionals, some rightwing politicians doing a moral panic.\n\n\nI find it curious the bill goes out of its way to specificly only ban cosmetic surgery for children trying to appear more like the opposite gender. They could have just done a full ban on child plastic surgery here with roughly the same arguments that it can be life altering, they are too young to know better, it can go wrong. The language of the bill seems to specifically leave the door open for specific kinds of cosmetic surgery on children... Which is odd.\n\nIt also mentions a bunch of procedures that could happen in gender affirming surgery... Or a number of other surgeries. So Republicans are sticking red tape around medical procedures which could be life saving for people... To stop a child, a parent, and doctors from performing a theoretical gender affirming surgery on a minor... That by the GOP's own admission here does not generally happen beyond  the referral phase...\n\nAlso \n\n>) Gender means the psychological, behavioral, social, and cultural\naspects of being male or female;\n\nIt then mentions gender altering procedures and the word gender several times... So should I take that to mean that a psychologist helping the family of a transgender minor deal with getting them a new name, clothes, and treating them as one gender or the other is against this law as a gender altering procedure?\n\nAlso the bill mentions how parents can sue if somehow a gender altering procedure was done without their knowledge... Somehow... \n\nBut what if the parent wants that for their kid after the kid comes out as trans? What if all parties agree that they want puberty blockers, and they want gender affirming care like a name change. Or new clothes. Or being called X pronouns now. Again. Physical surgery is not something minors really get. The bill admits this. \n\nBut hormone therapy and gender affirming care is. So what right does the GOP have to insert itself into that choice? Why is a political party going against medical and psychological consensus, parental choice, and the children's own gender identity, to push their idea on what the child should be? Why do Republicans get the first and last word on this choice for someone else's kid against that kid's doctors?\n\nSeems to me like once again Republicans are legislating solutions for problems that don't exist.

A search of Mr. Casey\u2019s archives at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University turned up no documents indicating whether he was in Dallas then or not.  \n>  \n>Mr. Barnes said he was certain the point of Mr. Connally\u2019s trip was to get a message to the Iranians to hold the hostages until after the election. \u201cI\u2019ll go to my grave believing that it was the purpose of the trip,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t freelancing because Casey was so interested in hearing as soon as we got back to the United States.\u201d Mr. Casey, he added, wanted to know whether \u201cthey were going to hold the hostages.\u201d\n\nThere's a lot more to the article, but I do wonder what will exactly happen after this, I mean most of the people invoked are old or dead, and we're still living in the world after the interference. Still, at least future historians can learn, if it's not wiped ut of history books in states like Florida. or something.\n\nEdit, I don\u2019t know, maybe after decades I\u2019m just exhausted of ways to put this stuff in words, combined with, the weight that the whole of the political world might be because of a giant act of electoral sabotage from before you were born.", "completion": "I wish something would've happened in response to this, but this has been known for some time.

Now who would you want, a person who is bat shit crazy but sounds and talks like a somewhat normal person (DeSantis) or someone who is bat shit crazy and actually acts like a bat shit crazy loon?\n\nI get this sentiment, but I kind of want DeSantis to win the nomination. On one hand, I think he's more dangerous than Trump, since he's smarter, more knowledgeable about government, and less impulsive. OTOH, he lacks Trump's charisma, ability to think on his feet and play a crowd, his voice is very whiny, and, most importantly, I think DeSantis would step aside if Trump were to win the nomination, but I don't think Trump would if the roles were reversed. So if DeSantis wins the nomination, unless Trump is dead, they have to deal with him being a sore loser, telling his supporters not to vote, or not to vote for the GOP, or even running as a third-party/independent candidate and acting as a spoiler for the GOP.\n\nI truly think Trump might see it as preferable for Biden to win reelection than for another Republican to win. If DeSantis wins, Trump is no longer the head of the party. DeSantis will overshadow him, and I don't think Trump would like, or allow, that. Especially since Trump already lost to Biden, so it would just show DeSantis is so much better than Trump. I think he'd rather watch DeSantis lose to Biden and then play \"I told you so\" and blame the GOP for nominating DeSantis, and go \"I would've won\" until they lose their minds. I think he'd go so far as to sabotage DeSantis to get it. What would he have to lose? If DeSantis wins in 2024, he would almost certainly be the GOP nominee again in 2028, and if Trump is even still alive in 2032, he'll be too old to run again then.\n\nRealistically, there are no good options for the GOP nominee.

Howell is hardly a household name, though her rulings in the politically charged cases in her court could be consequential.\r  \n\r  \nHer successor, James E. Boasberg, may be even less well known outside of Washington, but now will decide how far special counsel Jack Smith can go in investigating or questioning the former president. Among his most consequential decisions: whether Smith can compel former vice president Mike Pence to testify before a grand jury investigating Trump\u2019s push to overturn the 2020 election.\r  \n\r  \nIn recent months, the federal courthouse in D.C. has been buzzing with secret and not-so-secret proceedings over whether White House aides or Trump lawyers can be similarly made to testify, and whether records of a member of Congress can be used by the Justice Department. In addition to exploring attempts to interfere in the transfer of presidential power after the 2020 election, Smith is leading a criminal investigation into whether the former president or his allies mishandled classified documents. Howell at least partially granted a request from prosecutors to force Trump attorney Evan Corcoran to testify before the grand jury in the documents case, two people briefed on the decision said Friday.\r  \n\r  \nAs the chief judge, Howell \u2014 and now, Boasberg \u2014 are designated based on seniority and serve as a top administrator for the court, responsible for overhauling court pandemic operations, gearing up for Jan. 6 prosecutions, and deciding emergency legal issues or day-to-day courthouse witness security measures.

Trump supporters aren't going to be able to cause a ton of problems in Manhattan, especially as they are prepping.  It's also not a charge that his supporters care that much about, it's not a charge against MAGA like Georgia or the DOJ cases, so his supporters aren't going to have as much political motivation to really protest it.  Once this has passed through the news cycle a few times I think people will kinda go numb to him getting indicted so the next indictments will go over without as much shock, all the shock is really going to be focused on this first \"bullshit\" indictment.  \n\nI think anti-climactic is the goal for this.  They don't want any extra trouble.  \n\nI think the Georgia venue is probably going to be the most problematic.  \n\nAlso, you can compare it to Jan 6th, I guess, but I think the situations are extremely different and I don't think he's going to have people rallying around him the same way at this point.  Sure, there might be some willing, but they aren't really fighting for anything like they were with the Jan 6th, where they had been lied to about everything, etc.  The motivation to protect Trump from prosecution isn't going to be as much as the motivation to preserve his president in January of 2021.", "reply_score": 1, "reply_id": "jcprvhe"}

Blake's order to vacate a row of four seats in the \"colored\" section in favor of a White passenger, once the \"White\" section was filled.[2] Parks was not the first person to resist bus segregation, but the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) believed that she was the best candidate for seeing through a court challenge after her arrest for civil disobedience in violating Alabama segregation laws, and she helped inspire the Black community to boycott the Montgomery buses for over a year. The case became bogged down in the state courts, but the federal Montgomery bus lawsuit Browder v.
