{"prompt": "This may be a good solution to a horrible problem but I have a bunch of questions. My knowledge on this subject is lacking. I know of the emotional damage it does to a child and I know that most sex offenders are repeat offenders-like it is almost out of their control. I believe we have an obligation to protect all children. If this is something that works, I am for it. But if it doesn\u2019t work or causes other harm especially against children then I am against it.   Ok, on to my questions. \n\n#1. How would this be enforced? I know that CPS is supposed to protect children. Sometimes, they are lax and the children are damaged and sometimes even die because they are lax. Would there be a strong chain of enforcement to see that this man took his meds or would it be court ordered and we are supposed to trust him?  \n\n#2. If there is oversight, how competent is the oversight. Can he pretend to take the medicine and discreetly spit it out?  ( I ask this question because my granddaughter\u2019s bio-mom passed a drug test by taking one of her children\u2019s clean urine to a drug test, and although she was monitored, passed because she distracted the monitor.) \n\n#3. If this person takes the meds and is no longer able to sexually abuse children, does the person have other problems or are his sexual problems connected to other things. (Sorry I am so bad with words). What I am trying to say, is if he doesn\u2019t have the power to sexually abuse a child, does he have issues where his anger, when not able to attack a child sexually, would allow him to attack someone physically?  \n\nI felt sorry for Charles Manson. If you look at his childhood, it is no wonder that he turned out the way he did. By the same token, he deserved his incarceration and society deserved to be protected from him. If there is a way to allow this man to be released into society with no possible harm after he pays his consequences, I am for it. But if there are not stringent guidelines and a whole lot of monitoring, I am against it. Protect the innocent first, and then if there is a safe way to give this man his freedom, I am not against it.", "completion": "1. Typically the same way that house arrest or parole are enforced. The offender would need to check in with a case worker, who would also be present to ensure the drugs are being administered. They may also have to wear a monitoring device for some time after leaving prison.\n\n2. He most likely won't be given pills to take himself - the same medication can be delivered by an implant that isn't easily removed, or regular injections by medical professionals. Given those are the more effective delivery methods, they'd be more likely to be used.\n\n3. At the levels they give it, it dramatically adjusts hormone levels, and drastically decreases testosterone (90-95%). That same thing would likely lower aggression, in addition to essentially making sexual arousal nearly impossible. There are concerns over long-term side effects, and in an ideal world, it wouldn't be used. But, considering the alternatives, it's likely an acceptable risk that he would sign up for as an alternative to prison.", "reply_score": 3, "reply_id": "jcny693"}

It's that their collapse would have had an undue impact on society as a whole, reverberating through pretty much everyone and everything.  It was damn near apocalyptic then, and I do not mean that hyperbolically.  We were likely days away from complete financial ruin on a world-scale. It wasn't just bailing out banks; it was actively ensuring that society as we knew it didn't collapse in on itself as the world economy crumbled from a total lack of liquidity, damage caused by unmitigated risk, and the fallout that would happen from it.  The bailouts were necessary for everyone, not just banks.\n\nThese banks are not so heavily integrated into the wider economy, or so necessary, as to warrant that level of bailout.  It's two very different beasts.  They are smaller, more regional and local banks, and their failure will have only a minor impact to the economy at large. It's not 'fair', but it isn't cherry picking either; \nThere are actual, tangible reasons why the two types of banks are being treated differently beyond pure politics.\n\nNow, where the real bullshit came about is that nobody of importance was held accountable after the fact, no structural changes were made to prevent abuses of the system, and nothing really changed to discourage risk taking in the banking system. Further, nothing was put in place to serious dappen the impact of these banks being to large to be allowed to fail; what should have been done is significant regulation to mitigate the problems associated with severe risk-taking by banking institutions to make it so that not bailing them out would not have undo repurcussions on the wider economy, which would in turn disincentivise this behavior. This was not done, largely because of the relationships these banks have with politicians. However, the bailouts aren't the problem - they were and are a necessary evil. Rather, they are a symptom of the problem.\n\nLetting the larger banks fail isn't an option largely because of the implications of what this means. Letting them fail isn't going to just impact the banks - it will impact quite literally everyone. They essentially had, and still have, a dead-mans switch that will nuke the world into oblivion if they go under, and can leverage that fact.

Lupron Depot by AbbVie, as a puberty blocker.\n\nThey literally give this stuff to convicted rapists as a punishment and deterrent. Gender affirmation doctors are telling parents it is harmless.\n\n> California was the first U.S. state to specify the use of chemical castration for repeat child molesters as a condition of their parole, following the passage of a modification to Section 645 of the California penal code in 1996. This law stipulates castration for anyone convicted of child molestation with a minor under 13 years of age if they are on parole after their second offense. Offenders may not reject the intervention.\n\n> When used on males, these drugs can reduce sex drive, sexual fantasies, and capacity for sexual arousal. Life-threatening side effects are rare, but some users show increases in body fat and reduced bone density, which increase long-term risk of cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis, respectively. Males may also experience gynecomastia (development of larger-than-normal mammary glands in males); full development is less common unless chemical castration is combined with feminizing oestrogen therapy.\n\n> When used on females, the effects are similar, though there is little research about chemically lowering female's sex drive or female-specific anaphrodisiacs, since most research focuses on the opposite, but anti-androgenic hormone regimens would lower testosterone in females which can impact sex drive or sexual response. These drugs also deflate the breast glands and expand the size of the nipple.
